# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

The lockbox project

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to create a program that is able to detect faces and grant access to a physical lockbox of some kind. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I want to create a lockbox that unlocks using facial recognition software. My plan is to get a raspberry pi, or some other kind of mini computer, and attach a camera and lock to it. I want the scan itself to be pretty simple, either it opens after the facial scan or it blinks a red light that signifys that the faced scanned is invalid. As for the software itself I plan on using OpenCV in order to actually code the facial recognition software. Worse comes to worse if I'm unable to implement the facial recognition part I will modify my plan so that the box unlocks by using RFID technology or something similar. 



## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be a program that is able to detect faces and decide whether or not they are valid.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be if I'm able to take my software and upload load it to a raspberry pi. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be if I can get everything hooked up to a box of some kind. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The first step for my project will be to learn the OpenCV python library. This library gives you access to commands that are based around image processing and computer vision tasks. The next step will be to learn how raspberry pis work, and how I can add other kinds of hardware to them. For instance, if I plan to create a lockbox with my software I'll need to hook up a camera that can be used to scan faces. The third step will require me to learn how I can modify a lock so that it can be switched from locked to unlocked using signals from the raspberry pi.
