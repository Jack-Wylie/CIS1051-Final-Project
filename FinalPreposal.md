# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

1- I would like to create a simple robot using a raspberry pi.

2 - Use a raspberry pi to create a retro game emulator.

3 - In class we talked about creating a laser tripwire, and honestly I really liked that idea. If I were to use that idea I think I would expand upon it and 
    add a camera that takes a photo of the person who tripped the laser. 

4 - LED display cube. I think it would be cool to create a little desk display that would change it's design based on certain factors, like the time of day.      

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I don't plan on collaborating with anyone for this project. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

1 - Can I use a kit in order to get the parts for the robot?
