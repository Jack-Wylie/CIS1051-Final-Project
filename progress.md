Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

When I first started this project I needed to spend a decent amount of time learning about facial recognition and the python library OpenCV. Once I had a good 
idea on how to get started I began to write my program. As of now my program is coming along well and I'll be done it within the next day or two. I've also begun to design the physcial lockbox portion of my project. I am getting a little concerned with the price of everything that I need to buy, but I'll talk about that down below. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have not constructed the phyical lockbox of my project, and my code isn't 100% complete yet (although it shouldn't take me much longer to do).

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

My problem with this project is how much I'm going to have to spend in order to get the components needed to build the box. Another problem that I had was that I found it difficult to actually code using the OpenCV library, but after watching a few tutorials I was able to figure out what I was doing.
