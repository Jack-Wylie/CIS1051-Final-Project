Problems with Project:
      Overall I didn't have too many problems actually coding this project, but I did have difficulty completing the original idea that I wanted to create. When
      I started brainstorming and coming up with my idea I originally invisioned that this would be an actual lockbox that I could physically interact with. However,
      once I actually began designing this project I quickly realized that the cost of all the materials and components was going to be a bit too much. I also realized
      that some of the components would also take a long time to ship out. When I realized my predicament I decided to just create something that didn't require me to 
      have to buy anything. That's when I decided that I should make my lockbox virtually, and I think the program turned out pretty good.
